  Conway's Game of Life is a simulator that was created with the intention to predict population growth and decay. Despite many of the complexities that encompass 'Life', Conway came up with these few simple rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

  These simple yet powerful rules provide a systematic way to simulate population growth with some rather interesting patterns.

  This rendition of Conway's Game of Life simulator was created by Ben Holland, Joe Gibson, and Gabe Hintz as a way to get a grasp on some objective C programming and also have a little bit of fun.
